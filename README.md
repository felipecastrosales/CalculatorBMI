   Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯
   </h2>

   In this application I didn't have so many problems, they were easy to solve and follow, to be honest. The biggest challenges came during the development of version 2.0, which I wil talk about.<br>
   In this version, I added good programming practices, making more readable, easier to understand and maintain, with methods, features, new widgets and styles.<br>
   The application, which was previously in the light mode, became the default, the dark mode. I intend to put the two modes available in the next versions that I develop.
